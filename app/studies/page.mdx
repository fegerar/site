<Small>E. Fermi Technical High School, Sep 2016 - July 2021</Small>

I learned the basics of programming, networking, and cybersecurity. During my time there, I partecipated at:
- **CanSat Competition** 2019, where we built a satellite that was launched in the stratosphere, and we arrived 2nd in the national competition.
- **CyberChallenge** 2020, where we had to solve a series of cybersecurity challenges, and we arrived 6th in the national competition.
