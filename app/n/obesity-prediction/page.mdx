# Intro to Machine Learning: Obesity Prediction

<AnimatedName />

In this post we will explore how to predict obesity using machine learning. 
We will use the [Obesity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels) to try different machine learning models and see which one performs best.

## The Dataset

We have 17 features and 2111 samples. For more informations about the dataset, you can check the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels).

## The Models

### Linear Regression

[Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. 

<LinearRegression />

With linear regression we aim to find the best line that fits the data. We can then use this line to predict new values.

Trying to predict the weight of a person based on the other features, we get the following results:

| Metric                  | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Mean Absolute Error     | 3.95  |
| Mean Squared Error      | 26.01 |
| Root Mean Squared Error | 5.10  |
